 aDiscord-Nations-Programs
This is all of the code related to my work in Discord Nations. It consists of webhooks and a bot that I am developing. All links are expunged from the Github repository since it is public.

## Date.js
The date sheet displays the in-game time which starts in 2019 and progresses 2 weeks for every day in the real world. Accordingly, every day between 10 and 11 PM EST, the bot sends a message to the Date channel in the Discord Server.

## Econ.js
This is the file that has the webhook that parses the Google Form for changes to the economy and displays the form as an embedded message into the moderator server for Discord Nations.

## Military.js
This is the file that has the webhook that parses the Google Form for changes to the military and displays the form as an embedded message into the moderator server for Discord Nations.

## Research.js
This is the file that has the webhook that parses the Google Form for research and construction, then displays the form as an embedded message into the moderator server for Discord Nations.
